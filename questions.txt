Question 1: 
Write a program that display a menu as following: 
a) Press 1 to let user enter 2 numbers and print their multiplication value.
b) Press 2 to let user enter 2 numbers and the program will calculate their summation. 
c) Press 3 to let user enter 3numbers then the program print the Maximum and
Minimum value entered.
d) Press 0 to Exit program.


Question 2: 

(Parking Charges):
1-A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. 
2-The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess 
of three hours. 
3-The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. 
4- Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.

Write a program that calculates and prints the parking charges for each of three customers 
who parked their cars in this garage yesterday. 
You should enter the hours parked for each customer.
Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format and...
should calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. 
Your outputs should appear in the following format: 


Question 3: 
Write a program to calculate the net salary for an employee in a company,
given that:
a) If salary is greater than 3000$, tax is 10%. 
b) If salary is greater than 5000$, tax is 15%. 
c) If salary is less than 3000$, tax is 5%. 
d) If salary is between 1000$ and 1500$ additional 200$ is added.


Question 4:
Write a program that tells the user whether this year is a leap year or not.
All years which are perfectly divisible by 4 are leap years except for century years (years ending 
with 00) which is leap year only it is perfectly divisible by 400. 
For example:
2012, 2004, 1968 etc are leap year but, 1971, 2006 etc are not leap year. Similarly, 1200, 1600, 
2000, 2400 are leap years but, 1700, 1800, 1900 etc are not.



Question 5: 
Write a single C++ statement to accomplish each of the following: 
a) Assign the sum of x and y to z and increment the value of x by 1 after the calculation. 
b) Decrement the variable x by 1 then subtract it from the variable total. 
c) Calculate the remainder after q is divided by divisor and assign the result to
(Write this statement in two different ways).
